# NCEE_COMPLEX_NETWORK

## Introduction

This project contains the data and source codes for the paper titled "How to quantify an examination? Evidence from physics examinations via complex networks".

All the codes run perfectly on Python 3.10, and the libraries used are as follows:

* matplotlib==3.9.1

* networkx==3.3

* numpy==1.26.4

* openpyxl==3.1.4

* pandas==2.2.2

We do not guarantee normal operation on other versions.

## How to use

All the data is stored in the "./data" folder. You just need to run the "main.py" file. 

If you use any of the related data or codes, please cite this paper. ^ _ï¼¾
